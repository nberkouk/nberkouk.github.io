      <p>14th December, 3-4:30 pm CET</p>
      <ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

      <li>Rick Jardine (WU, Canada) : <i>UMAP for the working mathematician </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: The Healy-McInnes UMAP algorithm is a highly successful clustering tool that involves interesting ideas from mathematics and data science:
            <p>
                <br> Spivak's theory of extended pseudo metric spaces (ep-metric spaces)
                <br> TDA constructions in ep-metric spaces
                <br> weighted graphs
                <br> classical dimension reduction
                <br> graph optimization: fuzzy sets, cross entropy
            </p>
        I will explain this algorithm from a mathematical point of view.

      <li>Jun Zhang (Université de Montréal) : <i>Triangulated persistence category </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: In this talk, we will introduce a new algebraic structure called triangulated persistence category (TPC). A TPC combines the persistence module and the classical triangulation structure so that a meaningful measurement, via cone decomposition, can be defined on the set of objects. We will also elaborate on various examples of TPC that come from algebra, topology, and symplectic geometry. Finally, we will investigate the Grothendieck group of a TPC and explain several unexpected properties. This talk is based on joint work with Paul Biran and Octav Cornea.

      <li> Léonid Polterovich (Tel Aviv University) : <i>Persistence barcodes in symplectic topology </i> </li>
          <br> <b> Abstract</b>: I shall review some applications of the theory of persistence modules
in symplectic topology.

      <li> Magnus Botnan (VU, Netherlands) : <i>Signed barcodes for multiparameter persistence</i></li>
      <br> <b> Abstract</b>: Moving from persistent homology in one parameter to multiparameter persistence comes at a significant increase in complexity. In particular,
the notion of a barcode does not generalize straightforwardly. However, in this talk, I will show how it is possible to assign a unique barcode
to a multiparameter persistence module if one is willing to take Z-linear combinations of intervals. The theoretical discussion will be complemented
by numerical experiments. This is joint work with Steffen Oppermann and Steve Oudot.

	<h2>Presentation of the seminar</h2>

<ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

  The theory of persistence was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise - the so-called barcodes.
  Persistence theory has now been studied and used in different mathematical contexts: homotopy theory, sheaves, symplectic geometry...

  The aim of this seminar is to gather the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of  persistence.
