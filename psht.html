	<h2>What ? </h2>

<ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

  The theory of persistence was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise - the so-called barcodes.
  Persistence theory has been studied and used in different mathematical contexts: homotopy theory, sheaves, symplectic geometry...

  The aim of this seminar is to gather the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of  persistence.
