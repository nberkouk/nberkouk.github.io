      <li>Michael Lesnick  (SUNY Albany) : <i>l^p-Metrics on Multiparameter Persistence Modules </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>:  Motivated both by theoretical and practical considerations in topological data analysis, we generalize the p-Wasserstein distance on barcodes to multiparameter persistence modules. For each p ∈ [1,∞], we in fact introduce two such generalizations d_I^p and d_M^p, such that d_I^∞ equals the interleaving distance and d_M^∞ equals the matching distance.  Finally, we show that on 1- or 2-parameter persistence modules over prime fields, d_I^p is the universal (i.e., largest) metric satisfying a natural stability property; this result extends a stability theorem of Skraba and Turner for the p-Wasserstein distance on barcodes in the 1-parameter case, and is also a close analogue of a universality property for the interleaving distance given by the second author.  We also show that d_M^p ≤ d_I^p for all p ∈ [1,∞], extending an observation of Landi in the p = ∞ case.  We observe that the distances d_M^p can be efficiently approximated.  In a forthcoming paper, we apply some of these results to study the stability of (2-parameter) multicover.

      <li>Yuichi Ike  (University of Tokyo)  : <i>Interleaving distance for sheaves and displacement energy in symplectic geometry </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: I will talk about some interactions among the microlocal theory of sheaves, persistence modules, and symplectic geometry. The microlocal theory of
        sheaves has been applied to symplectic geometry after the pioneering work
        of Tamarkin. Motivated by the work of Kashiwara and Schapira, we introduce
        a persistence-like distance on the Tamarkin sheaf category and prove a stability
        result for a Hamiltonian deformation of sheaves. Using this result, we give
        a sheaf-theoretic method to give a lower bound of the displacement energy of
        compact subsets of a cotangent bundle, which is a quantitative generalization
        of Tamarkin's non-displaceability theorem.
        Joint work with Tomohiro Asano.

      <ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

      <li>Rick Jardine (WU, Canada) : <i>UMAP for the working mathematician </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: The Healy-McInnes UMAP algorithm is a highly successful clustering tool that involves interesting ideas from mathematics and data science:
        <p> <br> 1) Spivak's theory of extended pseudo metric spaces (ep-metric spaces)
                <br> 2) TDA constructions in ep-metric spaces
                <br> 3) weighted graphs
                <br> 4) classical dimension reduction
                <br> 5) graph optimization: fuzzy sets, cross entropy</p>
        I will explain this algorithm from a mathematical point of view.

      <li>Jun Zhang (Université de Montréal) : <i>Triangulated persistence category </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: In this talk, we will introduce a new algebraic structure called triangulated persistence category (TPC). A TPC combines the persistence module and the classical triangulation structure so that a meaningful measurement, via cone decomposition, can be defined on the set of objects. We will also elaborate on various examples of TPC that come from algebra, topology, and symplectic geometry. Finally, we will investigate the Grothendieck group of a TPC and explain several unexpected properties. This talk is based on joint work with Paul Biran and Octav Cornea.

  <p>9th November, 3-4:30 pm CET</p>

      <li> Léonid Polterovich (Tel Aviv University) : <i>Persistence barcodes in symplectic topology </i> </li>
          <br> <b> Abstract</b>: I shall review some applications of the theory of persistence modules
in symplectic topology.

        <br> ~

      <li> Magnus Botnan (VU, Netherlands) : <i>Signed barcodes for multiparameter persistence</i></li>
      <br> <b> Abstract</b>: Moving from persistent homology in one parameter to multiparameter persistence comes at a significant increase in complexity. In particular,
the notion of a barcode does not generalize straightforwardly. However, in this talk, I will show how it is possible to assign a unique barcode
to a multiparameter persistence module if one is willing to take Z-linear combinations of intervals. The theoretical discussion will be complemented
by numerical experiments. This is joint work with Steffen Oppermann and Steve Oudot.

	<h2>Presentation of the seminar</h2>

<ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

  The theory of persistence was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise - the so-called barcodes.
  Persistence theory has now been studied and used in different mathematical contexts: homotopy theory, sheaves, symplectic geometry...

  The aim of this seminar is to gather the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of  persistence.
