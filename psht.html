      <li> Barbara Giunti  (TU Graz)  : <i>Amplitudes in persistence theory</i></li>
        
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: In persistence theory, one starts with data and then build a parameterized object from them, which is then analysed via some invariants, typically retrieved using homology. This pipeline is stable in 1-parameter persistence, where the invariants are all given by the barcode. Since there is no proper generalization of barcode in the multiparamenter case, the choice of the invariants - which is strictly related to the choice of the distances used to ensure the stability of the persistence pipeline - depends on the specific information one wants to extract from the data. Different invariants may greatly vary their behaviour and be stable only under very different distances.
With the goal of addressing this problem, we introduce amplitudes, which are invariants that arise from assigning a non-negative real number to each persistence module, and are monotone and subadditive in an appropriate sense. There are different ways to associate a distance to an amplitude, which is useful in practical applications. Indeed, this gives us the possibility to define metrics based on the wanted invariants and fine-tune the stability results. Our framework is very comprehensive, as many different invariants that have been introduced in the Topological Data Analysis literature are examples of amplitudes. Furthermore, many known distances for multiparameter persistence can be shown to be distances from amplitudes. In addition, this framework allows us to compare different distances and can be used to prove new stability results.

      <li> Wojciech Chachólski (KTH, Stockholm): <i> Realisations of Posets and tameness </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>:  My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  (arXiv:2112.12209). I will present a construction called realisation,  transforming posets into posets  which are particularly suitable for persistence methods. Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of $\mathbf{N}^r$ is $[0,\infty)^r$. Our key results can be summarised as:  realisations share key features with upper semilattices, which explains  why they fit well with persistence. This is unexpected as for example  the realisation of an  upper semilattice may fail to be an  upper semilattice. I will illustrate for example that realisations and  upper semilattics share  key homological properties. For instance the homological  dimension (the length of the minimal free resolution) and Betti numbers of tame vector space valued functors indexed by both realisations and upper semilattices  can be calculated using Koszul complexes. Consequently,  calculating   these invariants for functors indexed by  both types of posets can be  done directly, avoiding constructing explicit resolutions.

      <li>Adam Brown  (IST Austria)  : <i>Computing Minimal Injective Resolutions</i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: Efficient algorithms for computing classical operations on sheaves are necessary to further develop applications of derived sheaf theory in topological data analysis. Injective resolutions, a fundamental `first-step’ in this pipeline, are used to study sheaves from the derived perspective, i.e. as objects in a derived category. In this talk we will discuss methods for computing injective resolutions of sheaves on simplicial complexes. We will outline the existence and uniqueness of minimal injective resolutions, an algorithm for their construction, and (time permitting) give an asymptotically tight bound on the computational complexity of this algorithm. This talk is based on joint work with Ondrej Draganov.

      <li>Michael Lesnick  (SUNY Albany) : <i>l^p-Metrics on Multiparameter Persistence Modules </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>:  Motivated both by theoretical and practical considerations in topological data analysis, we generalize the p-Wasserstein distance on barcodes to multiparameter persistence modules. For each p ∈ [1,∞], we in fact introduce two such generalizations d_I^p and d_M^p, such that d_I^∞ equals the interleaving distance and d_M^∞ equals the matching distance.  Finally, we show that on 1- or 2-parameter persistence modules over prime fields, d_I^p is the universal (i.e., largest) metric satisfying a natural stability property; this result extends a stability theorem of Skraba and Turner for the p-Wasserstein distance on barcodes in the 1-parameter case, and is also a close analogue of a universality property for the interleaving distance given by the second author.  We also show that d_M^p ≤ d_I^p for all p ∈ [1,∞], extending an observation of Landi in the p = ∞ case.  We observe that the distances d_M^p can be efficiently approximated.  In a forthcoming paper, we apply some of these results to study the stability of (2-parameter) multicover.

      <li>Yuichi Ike  (University of Tokyo)  : <i>Interleaving distance for sheaves and displacement energy in symplectic geometry </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: I will talk about some interactions among the microlocal theory of sheaves, persistence modules, and symplectic geometry. The microlocal theory of
        sheaves has been applied to symplectic geometry after the pioneering work
        of Tamarkin. Motivated by the work of Kashiwara and Schapira, we introduce
        a persistence-like distance on the Tamarkin sheaf category and prove a stability
        result for a Hamiltonian deformation of sheaves. Using this result, we give
        a sheaf-theoretic method to give a lower bound of the displacement energy of
        compact subsets of a cotangent bundle, which is a quantitative generalization
        of Tamarkin's non-displaceability theorem.
        Joint work with Tomohiro Asano.

      <li>Rick Jardine (WU, Canada) : <i>UMAP for the working mathematician </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: The Healy-McInnes UMAP algorithm is a highly successful clustering tool that involves interesting ideas from mathematics and data science:
        <p> <br> 1) Spivak's theory of extended pseudo metric spaces (ep-metric spaces)
                <br> 2) TDA constructions in ep-metric spaces

      <li>Jun Zhang (Université de Montréal) : <i>Triangulated persistence category </i></li>
        <br> <b> Abstract</b>: In this talk, we will introduce a new algebraic structure called triangulated persistence category (TPC). A TPC combines the persistence module and the classical triangulation structure so that a meaningful measurement, via cone decomposition, can be defined on the set of objects. We will also elaborate on various examples of TPC that come from algebra, topology, and symplectic geometry. Finally, we will investigate the Grothendieck group of a TPC and explain several unexpected properties. This talk is based on joint work with Paul Biran and Octav Cornea.

      <li> Magnus Botnan (VU, Netherlands) : <i>Signed barcodes for multiparameter persistence</i></li>
      <br> <b> Abstract</b>: Moving from persistent homology in one parameter to multiparameter persistence comes at a significant increase in complexity. In particular,
the notion of a barcode does not generalize straightforwardly. However, in this talk, I will show how it is possible to assign a unique barcode
to a multiparameter persistence module if one is willing to take Z-linear combinations of intervals. The theoretical discussion will be complemented
by numerical experiments. This is joint work with Steffen Oppermann and Steve Oudot.

	<h2>Presentation of the seminar</h2>

<ul style="font-family:'Optima';">

  The theory of persistence was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise - the so-called barcodes.
  Persistence theory has now been studied and used in different mathematical contexts: homotopy theory, sheaves, symplectic geometry...

  The aim of this seminar is to gather the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of  persistence.
